=============

A Vernacular Cantonese translation of George Orwell's Nineteen Eighty-Four, written with primordial characters (本字). 

The goal of this project was to promote writing in Cantonese, and moreover to promote a written Cantonese standard that people would not unfairly disparage as "slang", "uneducated", "ugly", or most ludicrously, "made-up". To this end, the text of this translation contains many archaic characters picked for their definitions and readings that are not in common usage in Standard Chinese (i.e. Formal Mandarin), as well as phonetic loans that differ from what might be found in modern tabloids and comics. 

Of course, I also hihgly enjoy the book itself. That this happened to be a highly political book that I translated whilst Hong Kong struggles with installing democracy was most likely a coincidence.
