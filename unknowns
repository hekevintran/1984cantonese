電幕把聲停著一陣，用一個嚴好多己聲調話：「注意等候十五點半己重要宣告。十五點半啊！極端重要己新聞來己，小心毋好錯過。十五點半！」尖細己音樂又開始。

溫斯頓覺得
part3/6.tex	。箇個就係前線己公告；直覺話畀佢知係壞事情。成日，
part3/6.tex	爾個念頭時時令佢興奮。佢想象到歐亞軍擁過未侵犯過己邊境，猶如一戙螞蟻落非洲己尖。點解無辦法從側翼包抄佢地己？佢淸楚感記得起非洲己西岸。佢執隻馬，
part3/6.tex	。最正己位喺箇道啦。見到黑羣衝緊向南邊箇時，都同時見到另一隊，神祕感聚集著喺道，突然間
part3/6.tex	喺佢地後邊，切斷
part3/6.tex	。佢覺得如果佢希望，就可以
part3/6.tex	。不過必須快尐逳手。如果佢地佔領到成個非洲，如果佢地喺好望角起到
part3/6.tex	同
part3/6.tex	，會
part3/6.tex	。毋知之後會點：戰敗、崩潰、重新分割世界、其黨己消滅！佢㪗一大啖氣。非常之混合己感情——而其實無混合；叫佢做一層層連續己、話毋出邊層喺底己感情更準——喺佢己心裏邊
part3/6.tex	。

抽筋完。佢擺返隻馬喺之前己位，暫時無心機畀硏究條題目。佢尐念頭。差毋多無意識感用隻手指喺檯面己塵寫：

２+２＝５

朱莉婭講過，「佢地入毋到你裏邊己。」但係佢地入到你裏邊己。「尐喺爾道發生己也會永遠跟住你，」奧巴仁講過。感先係眞相。有也，自己做己事，從中永遠恢復毋到。心口裏邊某樣也死著：
part3/6.tex	，
part3/6.tex	。

佢見過佢；同佢講過也添。無危險性。似乎佢直覺知佢地無物點理佢尐事幹。有人想己話，同佢約第二次見都得。其實佢地偶然撞到己。喺公園，三月風凛凛己一日，尐泥好似鐵感硬同尐草好似死澌同一朶花都無除著幾朶俾風吹𠞉著己番紅花箇時。佢手凍凍眼溼溼喺道走緊就見到佢，無十米距離。卽刻含糊發現某方面上佢變著。佢地扮毋識感行過大家，溫斯頓就求祈擰轉面，
part3/6.tex	。佢知毋危險性，無人會理佢。朱莉婭無講也。本來
part3/6.tex	感行似乎想鬆佢，卒之由得溫斯頓行喺佢身邊。佢地喺一堆無葉己
part3/6.tex	，對埋藏或擋風都無用。佢地停低。天氣凍冰冰。尐風
part3/6.tex	過尐樹枝，騷擾住尐
part3/6.tex	邋塌己番紅花。溫斯頓用隻手繳住朱莉婭條腰。
